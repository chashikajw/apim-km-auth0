# Integrate Auth0 as a Third Party Key Manager for WSO2 API Manager

This Auth0 key manager implementation allows you to integrate the WSO2 API Developer Portal with an external Identity and Access Management server (IAM)
by using the Auth0 OAuth Authorization Server to manage the OAuth clients and tokens required
by WSO2 API Manager. We have a sample client implementation that consumes the APIs exposed by Auth0.

## Getting Started

To get started, go to [Integrate WSO2 API Manager 3.2.0 with Auth0](docs/config.md).

## Build

APIM 3.x version related code can be found in the master branch.

Use the following command to build this implementation
`mvn clean install`
